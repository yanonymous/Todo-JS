# Todo-JS

A Todo app made in javascript (CLI app)

# To Run

If you want to try this out

Install Node.js (Easily available)

Then install chalk and lowdb with command

  * `npm install`
  
  This alone will install all dependencies

Currently have 4 commands

  * new:      used to create a new todo 
  * get:      used to retrieve your todos
  * complete: used to mark a todo as complete
  * help:     used to print the usage guide


Still have some bugs will fix it soon
